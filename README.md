Welcome to "Decoding Azure OpenAI: A Developer's Guide". This comprehensive guide is tailored to assist developers in constructing robust Large Language Model (LLM) architectures and applications using Azure OpenAI as the core processing engine. The goal is to tackle the complexities developers encounter, offer pragmatic solutions to intricate challenges, and unlock the immense potential of Azure's OpenAI services.


## üõ†Ô∏è From Challenges to Solutions

The series embraces a focused problem-solution framework, pairing each challenge with a detailed article and a complementary Jupyter notebook. This structured approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of the solution conceptually and practically.
