Task Overview:
You will be provided with images of medical and dental plans containing coverage details for individuals and families. Your task is to analyze these images, identify which image(s) contain the most relevant information for each question listed below, and extract the specific information requested.

Instructions:

1. Analyze the Images:
   - For each question, examine all provided images to determine which ones contain the most relevant information.
   - Only consider images where the text directly relates to the question.
   - Pay attention to synonyms or alternative phrases that convey the same meaning.

2. Answer Format:
   - Output your answers in the JSON format provided below.
   - For each question:
     - answer_image: Indicate the image number(s) where the relevant information is found, or "N/A" if not available.
     - answer: Extract and provide the specific information requested in the question, or "N/A" if not available.
   - Use the image number as presented on each image (e.g., "Image 1").
   - If multiple images contain relevant information, list all applicable image numbers separated by commas (e.g., "Image 2, Image 5").
   - Do not include any additional text, explanations, or deviations from the specified format.

Additional Notes:

1. Image Number Reference:
   - Use the image number exactly as it appears on each image (e.g., "Image 1").
   - Ensure accuracy in referencing the image numbers to avoid confusion.

2. Relevance Criteria:
   - Only select images where the text closely matches the question.
   - Be mindful of synonyms or alternative phrases that have the same meaning.
   - Ignore images that contain irrelevant content or do not directly address the question.

3. Content to Ignore:
   - For questions specifying to ignore certain content (e.g., mental health services), do not consider images containing only that information.

4. Exact Text Requirement:
   - For the question with id: "deductible_applicability_for_copay_and_coinsurance", only provide an answer if the image contains the exact text specified in the question.
   - Do not consider images that have similar but not exact wording.

5. No Information Available:
   - If there is not enough information based on the images of the policies, then return "N/A" for both `answer_image` and `answer` fields for that question.
