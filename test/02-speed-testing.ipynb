In many religious contexts, the meaning of life is often linked to the fulfillment of a divine purpose or adherence to spiritual laws. Philosophically, it has been explored from various angles, including existentialism, which suggests that meaning is not inherent but rather created through individual choice and action. In a general sense, many people find meaning through connections with others, achievements, personal growth, the pursuit of happiness, and the quest to understand one's place in the universe.
